            <p>In order to integrate data from many users, while protecting private data, we must store data on your
                server. User contact information is collected for optional display with your gene sets to foster
                collaborative research.</p>

            <p>Entering user information is not mandatory.</p>

            <p>User information will not be sold or otherwise distributed.</p>

            <p>GeneWeaver records some information about how the site is used such as the IP address
                of machines accessing data sets. This information is used to monitor our system performance, to prevent
                abuse of the system, and to guide further development of the GeneNetwork. This information is stored on
                the server in files that are accessible to members of the development group. Specific information will
                not be released.</p>

            <p>When you visit GeneWeaver, your use of the site is recorded in two ways. First, your
                use is logged by the Web server in standard log files. The IP address of your machine, the date and
                time, and the name of the page you visit are recorded. Second, for each request from the SQL database,
                the GeneNetwork records your IP number, the time, and the data set from which you request information.
                This information is collected for statistical purposes. Our system uses a software program (Analog) to
                create summary statistics that we find helpful in assessing patterns of data use, in measuring system
                performance, and in detecting problem. This information is used to provide you with better internet
                service.</p>

            <p>GeneWeaver also may request permission to place a so-called &#39;cookie&#39; text file
                on your system to allow you to retain information on your set-up preferences.</p>

            <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this server remains available to users,
                this computer system employs programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to
                upload or change information, and to detect unusally high numbers of requests from single IP addresses.
                By accessing this site, you expressly consent to usage monitoring of this site for unauthorized or
                unusually activities. Unauthorized attempts to upload information and change information on GN are
                prohibited.</p>

            <p>In some cases, personal identifier information such as name or e-mail is requested or
                required. This information may be posted for public access along with the submitted comments and
                messages that it accompanies. In all cases, participation is strictly voluntary and no other use is made
                of the information. User data can be labeled as private, group or public on submission. Permissions can
                be changed. GeneSets that are not marked as public will not be included in global anlayses of the
                database contents. </p>
