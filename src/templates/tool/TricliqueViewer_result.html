<p>This is an advanced tool that allows you to download the raw association matrix for the GeneSets you selected.
This file contains tab-separated values (which can be loaded into Excel). The values in the top-left are the number of
genes and number of GeneSets, respectively, followed by the Geneset IDs. The second row contains the matching GeneSet
abbreviations. In following rows there is an internal ODE gene identifier and the official gene symbol. The internal ODE
identifier will be a unique integer for each gene, but will not be consistent across database updates so should not be
permanantly recorded. However, a negative identifier does indicate a homology cluster for the given gene. Each row will
contain a 1 if the gene is found in the corresponding GeneSet, or a 0 if it was not contained in that GeneSet.</p>
