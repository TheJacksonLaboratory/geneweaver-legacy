    Runs a similarity analysis--calculates jaccard coefficients between the
    given gene set and all others in the database using a stored procedure.
    This is a minimal tool wrapper around a stored procedure:
    calculate_jaccard. It is implemented as a tool so 1) the application
    doesn't block as the procedure is running and 2) the user can navigate away
    from the view similar gene sets page without killing the procedure run
    early.
    Since this is just a minimal tool, it doesn't require status checking or
    redirecting to a results page on completion like all the other tools.
