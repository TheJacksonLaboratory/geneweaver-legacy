Enter how many of your top microarray results you would like to test 
for enrichment ('1000' for the top 1000, '2000' for the top 2000, etc.)
1: 100
Enter the number of simulated results to generate (1000, 5000, 10000, etc.)
1: 10000

INPUT FILES
Expression data file:
/svr/geneweaver/website-py/src/tools/mset/smallTestCase/topSize100/backgroundSmall.txt
99 unique gene IDs in top 100 microarray results.
3556 gene IDs in microarray background.

Database of genes of interest file:
/svr/geneweaver/website-py/src/tools/mset/smallTestCase/topSize100/interestSmall.txt
22 unique gene IDs in gene list of interest.

RESULTS
10000 simulated results of length 99 generated from background.
2 matches to database found in microarray results.
0.117 mean matches to database in simulated results.
41 simulated results of length 99 contained at least as many matches 
to database as the actual expression results.

p-value: 0.0041

ADDITIONAL INFO
2% of top selected expression results are matches to database.
0.15% of background genes are matches to database.
