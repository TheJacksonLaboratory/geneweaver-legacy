Enter how many of your top microarray results you would like to test 
for enrichment ('1000' for the top 1000, '2000' for the top 2000, etc.)
1: 10
Enter the number of simulated results to generate (1000, 5000, 10000, etc.)
1: 10000

INPUT FILES
Expression data file:
/svr/geneweaver/website-py/src/tools/mset/smallTestCase/backgroundSmall.txt
10 unique gene IDs in top 10 microarray results.
300 gene IDs in microarray background.

Database of genes of interest file:
/svr/geneweaver/website-py/src/tools/mset/smallTestCase/interestSmall.txt
21 unique gene IDs in gene list of interest.

RESULTS
10000 simulated results of length 10 generated from background.
9 matches to database found in microarray results.
3.5692 mean matches to database in simulated results.
2 simulated results of length 10 contained at least as many matches 
to database as the actual expression results.

p-value: 2e-04

ADDITIONAL INFO
