HOW TO RUN THESE TESTS
----------------------
Currently the tests folder in GeneWeaver website-py project includes only tests that can be run using the python
unittest tool.

You will run these tests from the project root directory (so that src and tests are subdirectories).

Before you can run these tests, you'll need to put the 'src' directory into your python path:

export PYTHONPATH=src/

Syntax for running tests -
To run all tests in the tests/ folder

    python -m unittest discover

To run one test file

    python -m unittest tests.test_application

To run one test class

    python -m unittest tests.test_application.HomeTestCase

To run one test

    python -m unittest tests.test_application.HomeTestCase.test_app_root
